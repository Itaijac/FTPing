# FTPing
Implementation of the File Transfer Protocol using pings. In order to transfer the file safely, this project is using window sizes, much like in the Transmission Control Protocol.

Running Instructions:
To run the code properly, set the SERVER_IP constnat in the "funcs.py" file to the IP of the running server, and run the program. A GUI will pop up where you will need to provide a few paramters. Once you do, hit "SEND". The file should be tranferred to the server by then.
